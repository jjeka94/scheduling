# scheduling
This project starts as a school project but now is a usable application. In collaboration whit IT company Miosoft I have created this application. The application is intended for companies but also for ordinary users and is used for scheduling appointments. To use this application you need to be registered. Each user can customize the application to their own needs. You need to set information about your company and you working hours. Each user enters the start and end of the working hours, as well as the length of the appointment. In the end, you get a table that looks like a calendar starting on Monday so you can see which appointments are booked and which are available.
I was using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
